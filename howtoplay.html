    <div class="instruction">
      <p>Blackjack is one of the most popular card games in the world. The main goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

        <p>Card Values:
        Number cards (2-10) are equal face value.
        Face cards like Jack, Queen, King equal 10.
        Aces can equal 1 or 11, it is up to the player to choose.</p>

        <p>Gameplay:
        Dealer and player starts with 2 cards, but dealer starts with 1 card face down.
        The player goes first and can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
        If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the round.
        After the player stands, the dealer reveals their faced-down card.
        The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust and the player wins.
        If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand closer to 21 wins.</p>

        <p>Winning and Losing:
        If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, the player wins and is paid out at even money (1:1).
        If the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round, regardless of the dealer's hand.
        If the player and dealer have hands of equal value, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned.
        If the player's starting hand, the 2 intial cards, have a value of 21, then the player has blackjack and wins, unless the dealer also has blackjack as well (push).
        Blackjacks are paid out at 3:2 ratio.</p>

        <p>Special Moves: Double Down: After receiving the first two cards,
        the player can choose to double their original bet, but the caviat is that they can only hit once.</p>
