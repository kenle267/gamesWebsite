    <title>Kenny Le's Website</title>
    <!-- 300 word write up:
        
    This webpage is meant to be an "About Me" page that gives a closer look at my personal interests, hobbies, and my hometown.
    It shows my passion for basketball as a game, sport, and way of connecting with other people, namely friends and family.
    I decided to apply an orange-to-white gradient for my background because it matched the yellow/orange color of some of my photos nicely.
    I wanted the main title/header of the page to stand out, so I made it noticeably bigger than the subheaders and bolded and black while making the 
    rest of the subheaders grey and underlined. Under the header, I centered a good picture of myself so the viewer could recognize me and see what I look like. 
    Directly under that, I give a quick greeting and introduction to who I am in case someone who does know me ends up on this page. 
    Since I knew I wanted to write mainly about my passion for basketball, I aligned the picture of myself playing basketball to the left so I could 
    have the section of text take up most of my page to give it more focus. I also put rounded boxes around the text boxes to give a more modern look 
    and get rid of the raw look to the website. For the final section, I wanted to show the viewer pictures that represent my diverse background, 
    so I showed a gallery of side-by-side pictures of my friends and I hanging out in Sacramento. For this section, I reverse the order by putting the text box
     on the left and the gallery of photos on the right. I approached the responsive design by using CSS media queries and changing the flex-flow of containers 
     from rows to columns so the pictures and text boxes fit better on a mobile screen. I incorporated alt texts and used specific HTML tags and classes to keep 
     track of what is being edited and improve accessibility. Some challenges I encountered in this assignment include resizing the pictures and text boxes so 
     that they look consistent and still legible, figuring out how to apply flex boxes to containers and manipulate them, and figuring out how to efficiently 
     manipulate photos without changing the entire container. By reviewing lecture slides and using approved resources, I was able to figure these out and 
     become a stronger web developer.

        <p class="round3">My favorite sport is basketball! Basketball has always been a fun past time that
            helps me stay active while allowing me to spend quality time with friends.
            Growing up, I was surrounded by basketball. During recess, everyone would rush to the basketball courts and play pick-up. When I got home,
            I would catch my dad watching the nightly NBA games on ESPN or ABC. Basketball was a fun way for me to bond with my friends and family.
            Although I only play it on a casual level, I still thoroughly enjoy it because it lets me express my creative side by giving me the freedom to do whatever
            I want to do on the court. Football and weight lifting are also two other activities that I enjoy in my free time.
